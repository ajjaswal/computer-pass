# computer-pass

## Description
   I used JavaScript to create a password generator that asks the number of characters you would like, whether you want to include uppercase, lowercase, symbolic, and or numerical characters. Once you have selected the criteria, I used math.random and math.floor to randomize the order of the characters selected to create a secure, original password.
